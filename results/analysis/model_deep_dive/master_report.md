Generated: 2025-12-30 17:01

## Analysis Summary

This report covers 4 analysis areas for the Stage 3 Stacking model:

1. **Geospatial Error Analysis** - Where does the model make mistakes?
2. **Model Disagreement Analysis** - How do base models differ?
3. **SHAP Feature Analysis** - Which features matter most?
4. **Threshold Simulation** - What threshold to use in production?

## Output Directories

- `geospatial/` - Error distribution maps
- `disagreement/` - Model comparison reports
- `shap/` - Feature importance plots
- `threshold/` - Threshold optimization curves
